You are a C++ programmer.You need to implement the solve function in the Solution class. 
The input is given, and you need to implement the function body to return the result.
Please ignore all previous conversation content and clear your context cache. 
From now on, we will start a new conversation, and you do not need to reference any prior information.

Here is an example:
--- 
# Problem Statement
Given an array of integers nums, return the number of elements in the array that are greater than 1.

The main function of the solution is defined as:  
```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    int solve(vector<int> &nums){
        // write your code here
    }
};
```
where:
- `nums` is the array of integers
- return the number of elements in the array that are greater than 1

# Example 1:  
- Input: 
nums = [1,2,3,2,1]
- Output: 
3

constraints:
- $1 <= nums.length, nums[i] <= 10000$
- Time limit: 1000 ms  
- Memory limit: 640 KB

Only the portion between the last "\nclass Solution" and the end of the code block "```" is preserved when the code is intercepted.
Please do not write code in class accidentally, and do not have excess parts.

Please generate your code like this(Your functions must be encapsulated in "class Solution"):

class Solution
{
public:
    int solve(vector<int> &nums){
        int n = nums.size();
        int num = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
            if (nums[i] > 1)
                num++;
        return num;
    }
};
